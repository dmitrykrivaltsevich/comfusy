COMFUSY: COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL SYNTHESIS
======================================

Homebrew users can easily install z3 via the formula in this
pull request: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/16188

This repository begins with the source code linked from that
page for scala 2.7.7, then ports the source to 2.8, 2.9, and
finally 2.10, moving from ant to sbt along the way.

I am unaffiliated with the authors of this code, I'm just
an interested observer who prefers scala 2.10.
