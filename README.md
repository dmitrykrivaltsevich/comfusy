Homebrew users can easily install z3 via the formula in this pull request: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/16188

The lara source was for scala 2.7 - this repository takes it to 2.8, 2.9, and finally 2.10, and also from ant to [sbt](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras/). I am unaffiliated with the authors of this code, I'm just an interested observer who prefers scala 2.10.
