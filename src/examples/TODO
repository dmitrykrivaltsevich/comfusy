- if variables have declared ranges, then they automatically become part of constraints
  (example with hours, minutes, etc - the ranges should appear as part of variable declarations)

- add examples of dependent variable programming (automatically enforcing PA constraint):
   * encoding array indices of 3-dimensional arrays
   * give loop invariant, synthesize fully integer body based on making purely integer VC true

- examples where we get non-uniqueness warnings

- add pattern matching as a construct and write examples for it
  * warnings for non-uniqueness and incompleteness

Say: PA is a nice compositional construct, well-defined class, with no
artificial restrictions, so more examples will come, much like they
come from higher-order functions.
